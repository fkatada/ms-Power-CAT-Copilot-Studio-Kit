# Webchat Playground
## Overview
Webchat Playground simplifies customizing the appearance and behavior of the copilot agent webchat, including colors, fonts, thumbnails and much more. Easy to use UI allows makers to define the look and feel of their webchat, and styles can be exported as JSON snippet or HTML sample.

Webchat Playground comes with predefined themes which demonstrate different customization options of the webchat, and can be used a starting point when designing a new theme. Makers can also create new themes and save them for future use.
