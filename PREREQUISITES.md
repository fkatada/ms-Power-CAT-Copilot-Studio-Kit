# Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit prerequisites

The Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit is built using Power Platform and requires adequate licensing and capacity.

## Mandatory requirements

- A [**Power Platform environment with Dataverse as a data store**](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-environment). <br>
  Microsoft Dataverse is used to store the Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit configuration and test tables data. <br>
  The user performing the installation of the Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit must have the **system administrator** security role on the environment.
- Adequate licensing to run a **Power Apps model-driven application**.
- Adequate licensing to run **Power Automate cloud flows** using **Premium** connectors.

> [!NOTE]
> Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit can be installed in the same environment where you host your custom agents, but this isn't mandatory. More information on licensing:
> - If installed as part of Power Platform, refer to [Microsoft Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130).
> - If installed as part of Dynamics 365, refer to  [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544)

## Dependencies

* This solution requires PCF Components to be enabled for the Dataverse Environment before you install any of the solution files.  You can find details of how to turn that feature on in the public documentation page below,
  * [Enabling Power Apps Component Framework Feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/component-framework/component-framework-for-canvas-apps#enable-the-power-apps-component-framework-feature)
 
* Copilot Studio Kit is using advanced components from the Creator Kit, please make sure to deploy it before deploying Copilot Studio Kit

## Optional requirements

- **AI Builder credits**.
  AI Builder prompts are used with the Test Automation and Prompt Advisor features of the Kit.

  **Test Automation**: AI builder can be used to analyze an AI-generated answer and compare it with a sample answer or validation instructions. Each Test Case of type "Generative Answers" will consume 50 credits on average (based on our testing), but the exact consumption can vary based on the length of the test utterance, response and other factors.

  **Prompt Advisor**: each iteration will consume 120 credits on average (based on our testing), but can vary based on the length of the prompt being analyzed and other factors.

- **Azure Application Insights**.<br>
  This integration is required to get additional telemetry details for AI-generated answers. <br>
  Refer to this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-bot-framework-composer-capture-telemetry?tabs=webApp) on how to integrate Azure Application Insights with Microsoft Copilot Studio.
