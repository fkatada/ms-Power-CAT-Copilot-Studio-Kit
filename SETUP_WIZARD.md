# Setup wizard
## Overview

Setup Wizard can be accessed from the home page of the Copilot Studio Kit. Setup Wizard provides a guided flow through most of the post deployment steps where pre-requisites are checked, connection references and environment variables can be set, and cloud flows can be turned on. You can move forward and backward between steps by clicking Back and Next buttons.
