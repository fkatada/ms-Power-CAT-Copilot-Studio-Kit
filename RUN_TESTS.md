# Running tests in Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit

**Test Runs** allow to execute multiple **Tests** contained in a single test set against a specific **Agent Configuration**.

## Creating a Test Run

1. Open the Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit application (as seen in [installation instructions](./INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md#access-the-copilot-studio-accelerator-app))
2. Navigate to **Test Runs**.
3. Create a **New** Agent Test Run record.
4. Provide a **Name**.
5. Select the desired **Agent Test Set**.
6. Select the desired **Agent Configuration**;
7. **Save**.

## Understanding what happens when a test runs

When saving a **Test Run** record, a few things happens sequentially:
1. A first cloud flow triggers, and runs all the tests against the specified agent configuration.
2. The **Run Status** moves from **Not Run** to **Running**.
3. Individual **Test Results** are created for each **Test**.
4. When it has finished running, the **Run Status** updates to **Complete**.
5. In case of **Error**, a link to the failed cloud flow is provided for further troubleshooting.
  
When the Run Status reaches **Complete**, additional cloud flows may kick-in, depending on the configuration:
1. **App Insights Enrichment Status** is set to **Pending** until the data becomes available in App Insights. It then updates to **Running** and **Complete** when done.
2. **Generated Answers Analysis** is set to **Pending** if App Insights Enrichment Status is configured so it runs after it. It then updates to **Running** and **Complete** when done.
3. **Dataverse Enrichment Status** is set to **Pending** until conversation transcript becomes available in Dataverse. It then updates to **Running** and **Complete** when done.

## Duplicating a Test Run

Users can quickly re-run the exact same test set by clicking on the Duplicate Run command.
This creates a copy of the record that immediately runs after saving.

Primary purpose for duplicating a test run is to allow rerunning the same test configuration at a) another time b) after making configuration changes c) after adding to the test set

## Rerunning a specific step

Users may rerun a specific child flow
- Enrich with App Insights
- Analyze with AI Builder
- Enrich with Dataverse
- Update Rollup Columns

Primary purpose of rerunning steps is to rerun enrichment steps in the case of temporary technical issues. Please note that rerun will only process test cases that are in *Success* or *Pending* status.
